# ðŸ§¹ Clean Enum - Nmap Output Cleaner

`Clean Enum` is a Python tool designed to **clean, structure, and classify** the output of network scans performed with tools like **Nmap**, **ldapsearch** making the results easier to read, organize, and analyze during pentesting enumeration phases.

This tool works as a **data-cleaning assistant**, helping you extract the most important information, classify critical vs non-critical ports, and identify the target's operating system.
